// This is the most common assignment operator
x = 0;
console.log('x:', x);

x++;
console.log('x:', x);

x = x + 1; // This equivalent to: x = x + 1
console.log('x:', x);

x = x + 5;
console.log('x:', x);

x += 5; // This is equivalent to: x = x + 5
console.log('x:', x);

x = x * 2;
console.log('x:', x);

x *= 2;
console.log('x:', x);

// This is equivalent to: x = x * 2

x /= 2;
console.log('x:', x);

// This is equivalent to: x = x / 2

x %= 2;
console.log('x:', x);

// This is equivalent to: x = x % 2

x = 2;
x **= 2;
console.log('x:', x);

// This is equivalent to: x = x ** 2
